# Lane-Detection-in-Foggy-Roads
newbies - Basic Project for Canny Edge Detection and Dehazing algorithm used to detect fog in roads.

The Lane detection system is implemented using OpenCV in python which can filter foggy roads and predict the lanes accurately for the ADAS to assist (Computer Vision Systems). This reduces the use of expensive sensors, thus making it affordable to be used in commercial vehicles for any terrain and climatic conditions. Even in foggy road conditions, the system can predict the lanes using various image processing techniques.

TOOL USED
• OpenCV is the library of algorithms of computer vision, image processing and 
numerical algorithms. 
• The software is developed using python language.
• It is designed for real-time applications.
• OpenCV is better for performance optimization
